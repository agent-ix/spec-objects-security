# IT-002: Module installs into Quoin with the semantic contract

## Objective

Verify the boundary between this module's shipped directory and the Quoin
module installer: `quoin module install path:<dir>` SHALL accept the
`semantic` block, resolve every reference-form `data_schema`, verify every
digest and `$ref`, derive the package manifest, and list the module. Without
this test, a module that Quire accepts but Quoin refuses would ship.

## Target Integration

The system under test is `spec_objects_security/` as consumed by a Quoin built
from `agent-ix/quoin` main at or after commit `3e842ce` (FR-070, FR-073,
FR-075). The integration type is a local CLI invocation over the filesystem;
no network read is involved.

## Preconditions

A Quoin built from `agent-ix/quoin` main at or after `3e842ce` is on `PATH`
(from a checkout: `make build && npm i -g .`; no release tag carries the
semantic module yet). The current `quoin module` listing is recorded so the
prior `spec-objects-security` entry (source, ref, sha) can be restored.

## Inputs

The module directory `spec_objects_security/` from this branch, containing
`manifest.yaml`, `schemas/`, and `skeletons/`.

## Test Procedure

1. Record `quoin module` output before the install.
   - IT-002-SC-01: the listing is captured, including any existing
     `spec-objects-security` entry.
2. Run `quoin module install path:<checkout>/spec_objects_security`.
   - IT-002-SC-02: exit code 0 and no `semantic.*` diagnostic at `error` severity.
3. Run `quoin module`.
   - IT-002-SC-03: the listing contains `spec-objects-security` sourced from
     the path.
4. Inspect the installed module root.
   - IT-002-SC-04: `semantic/package-manifest.json` exists with
     `package.identity` `agent-ix/spec-objects-security` and one export per
     `semantic.exports` entry.
5. Restore the prior state unconditionally, whether or not steps 2–4 passed:
   re-install the recorded source and ref, or remove the module if none was
   installed.
   - IT-002-SC-05: `quoin module` equals the recording of step 1.
   - IT-002-SC-06: the restore step runs even when an earlier step failed.

## Expected Results

The install succeeds with exit code 0, the module is listed, the derived
package manifest names the twenty-three exports, and the prior module state is
restored. The test passes only when every per-step success criterion holds.

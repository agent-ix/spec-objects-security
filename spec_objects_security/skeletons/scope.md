# [SCOPE-001] documents:read OAuth scope

OAuth 2.0 scope requested by third-party integrations that need read-only
access to a tenant's document library through the Atlas public API.

## Grants

- PERM-001 — read tenant documents (`document:read`)
- Listing document metadata via `GET /api/documents`
- Downloading rendered document content via `GET /api/documents/{id}/content`
- Excludes all write verbs; mutations require the separate `documents:write` scope

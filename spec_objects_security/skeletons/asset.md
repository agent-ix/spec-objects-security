# [ASSET-001] Session store

Redis cluster holding all active Atlas web sessions and CSRF token state.

## Description

The session store is the authority for who is currently authenticated:
compromise yields the ability to mint or hijack any active session across all
tenants, bypassing AUTHFLOW-001 entirely. It runs in the trusted private
subnet behind BOUND-001, accepts only mTLS connections from the auth service,
and persists nothing to disk (RDB/AOF disabled) so session identifiers never
reach backup media. Data it holds is classified Confidential (CLASS-001
handling applies to the embedded user identifiers).

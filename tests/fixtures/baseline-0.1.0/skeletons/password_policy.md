# [PASSPOL-001] Atlas local-account password policy

Applies to break-glass local accounts only; regular tenant users authenticate
through their IdP (AUTHFLOW-001). Aligned with NIST SP 800-63B: length over
composition, breach screening over forced rotation.

## Rules

- Minimum length 12 characters, maximum 128; all printable Unicode accepted
- Candidate passwords are checked against the haveibeenpwned k-anonymity API
  and rejected when previously breached
- No mandatory periodic rotation; rotation is forced only on suspected
  compromise
- Hashing: argon2id with memory 64 MiB, iterations 3, parallelism 4
- Rate limiting: 10 failed attempts per account per 15 minutes, then lockout
  with audit event emission

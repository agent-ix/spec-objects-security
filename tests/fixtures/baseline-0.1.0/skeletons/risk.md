# [RISK-001] Tenant account takeover via token theft

Business risk that an attacker realizes THREAT-001 and operates inside a
tenant with the victim's permissions, exposing Confidential PII (CLASS-001)
and enabling data exfiltration through the public API. Likelihood is rated
medium given commodity infostealer malware; impact is high because a single
takeover crosses into regulated personal data. Primary treatment is CTRL-001;
residual risk after rotation and reuse detection is accepted at low/high and
reviewed quarterly by the security council.
